# PSInet
11-785 Project

This is a Speech Representation project based on ESPnet


## Starting Instructions

This github uses submodules so you need to use `git clone --recurse-submodules git:github.com/hairyjay/PSInet.git` to get all of the code.

To install Espnet for use read the espnetInstallConda instructions.

## Replicating and Reading Results

Since we have two directions for our work, explored independently of each other, we separated our experiments off into two different folders, `CMA-ES Experiments` and `Wav2Vec Experiments`.

Results can be obtained by replicating the experiments within their respective folders. Instructions can be found within each folder.

Both of these folders contain a submodules of epsnet to handle their work.

## A Note on Commits

Past a certain point in time, almost all commits were made by Ravneet. This is because he is the only person on our team with access to the compute cluster where experiments were run. Development from that stage on were largely done collaboratively in live chat or zoom sessions.
