# PSInet
11-785 Project

This is a Speech Representation project based on ESPnet


## Starting Instructions

This github uses submodules so you need to use `git clone --recurse-submodules git:github.com/hairyjay/PSInet.git` to get all of the code.

To install Espnet for use read the espnetInstallConda instructions. 

Since we have two directions for our work, both explored independently of each other we separated our experiments off into two different folders, CMA-ES Experiments and Wav2Vec Experiments.

Both of these folders contain a submodules of epsnet to handle their work.
